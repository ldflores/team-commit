# Project Description
The purpose of our project is to better help students understand what college majors lead to the highest and lowest salaries and highest and lowest employment rates. Our target audience is students. They will be interested in salary range and level of employment in a relevant field. By providing this data to them we will aide them in their decision making process for choosing a college major. 

## The Data
Our data is from a fivethirtyeight file on Github. The data was collected from American Community Survey 2010-2012 which is a section of the census. The data shows College majors, the number of male and female graduates, number of unemployed people and the unemployment rate, median earnings of full time employees, 25th percentile of earnings, and 75th percentile of earnings.
